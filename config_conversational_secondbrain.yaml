# Optimized Configuration for Conversational "Second Brain" Content
# Best for: ChatGPT/Claude conversations, personal notes, knowledge management
# NOT optimized for: Code repositories, technical documentation

# === PROCESSING SETTINGS ===
vault_path: /Users/medici/Documents/MediciVault
dry_run: true
fast_dry_run: false  # Use AI analysis for better categorization
batch_size: 10  # Can process more since content is conversational
file_ordering: recent

# === PRIMARY MODEL (Conversational Content) ===
# qwen2.5:3b is PERFECT for natural language conversations
ollama_base_url: http://localhost:11434
ollama_model: qwen2.5:3b  # Fast, conversational, efficient
ollama_timeout: 60  # Shorter timeout for lighter model
ollama_max_retries: 3
ollama_temperature: 0.2  # Slightly higher for conversational nuance
ollama_max_tokens: 1500  # Sufficient for conversation analysis

# === EMBEDDING MODEL (Similarity Search) ===
# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for conversational content!
# Embeddings excel at finding semantic similarity in natural language
embedding_enabled: true
embedding_model: nomic-embed-text:latest  # Fast, excellent for conversations
embedding_similarity_threshold: 0.70  # Slightly lower for conversational content
embedding_top_k: 15  # More suggestions for richer connections

# Why embeddings matter for your use case:
# - Connects conversations about same topic with different wording
# - Finds semantic relationships AI analysis might miss
# - Better "second brain" with more interconnected knowledge
# - Minimal overhead after first run (cached embeddings)

# === FEATURES ===
cache_enabled: true
resume_enabled: true
incremental: true
max_cache_size_mb: 1500  # Moderate cache for conversational content
max_cache_entries: 15000

# === ADVANCED (Optional) ===
# Confidence threshold for manual review
confidence_threshold: 0.7  # Lower for conversational content
enable_review_queue: true
review_queue_path: reviews/

# Deprecated Configuration Files

This directory contains presets that are no longer maintained. They are kept only for reference and should not be used for new runs.

- `config_parallel_timeout.yaml` — older parallel-processing preset superseded by the active configs in `configs/`. Prefer `config_parallel_optimized.yaml` or tune `parallel_workers`/timeouts directly in `config.yaml`.
